# Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project, "Accident Severity Prediction," comes from the US Accidents dataset on Kaggle. It contains comprehensive accident data from February 2016 to December 2021, covering more than 49 states in the United States. The dataset includes over 2.8 million accident records, with features such as:

Location (city, state, county, and coordinates)
Time of the accident (start and end time)
Weather conditions (temperature, humidity, visibility, etc.)
Road conditions (street type, traffic signal, etc.)
Severity rating (scale of 1 to 4, with 4 being the most severe)
This dataset offers valuable insights into the factors contributing to road accidents and serves as the foundation for building predictive models to assess accident severity.
