1. Preprocessing.ipynb
This notebook focuses on cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis. Key steps include:

Calculating and handling null values.
Dropping rows with missing data and removing unnecessary columns.
Parsing columns for more effective analysis.
A scatterplot revealed that most severe accidents occurred in the Eastern Time Zone of the US, so the dataset was filtered to include only data from that region.
The cleaned data was saved to a new CSV file for further analysis.
2. Visualization_and_ML_Models.ipynb
This notebook covers both data visualization and the implementation of machine learning models.

Visualization: Various plots such as bar plots, scatterplots, heat maps, Plotly box plots, Folium heat maps, and pie charts were used to extract insights and understand the dataset better.
Machine Learning Models: Three models were applied: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier. The KNN Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 94.05%.
